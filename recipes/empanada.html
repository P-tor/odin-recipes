    <p>A traditional Chilean empanada with the perfect dough and filling.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork </li>
        <li>3 hard-cooked eggs, chopped </li>
        <li>1 cup raisins </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped black olives</li>
        <li>1 cup water </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch </li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm milk </li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt </li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten </li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper in the melted butter until the onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the ground pork and cook until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes more; drain the fat from the skillet. Stir the eggs, raisins, and olives into the mixture. Whisk the water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour into the skillet and stir until the liquid thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>

        <li>Whisk the milk and melted shortening together in a bowl until evenly blended. Stir the flour and salt together in a separate large bowl. Pour the wet mixture into the dry and whisk until well mixed into a dough. Set aside to rest for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Place the dough onto a lightly-floured board and roll to about 1/8-inch thick; cut into circles with a round cookie cutter or glass. Drop equal portions of the pork mixture into the center of each circle. Fold each circle in half and press edges with a fork to seal. Brush the tops of the empanadas with beaten egg.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
